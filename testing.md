### **1. Automated Testing** ###

**1.1 HTML Code Validating**

* All of the HTML files were tested on the [W3C HTML Markup Validation website](https://validator.w3.org/)
* All of the files came back clear with the exception of one warning. The validator said the footer section is missing a `<h2>` - `<h6>` header. I am aware of this warning but have left this as there are no `<h2>` - `<h6>` tags required in the footer.

### **2. Manual Testing** ###

**2.1 Manual testing desktop**

All desktop testing was carried out on Chrome, FireFox, Safari & Edge. To save repetition in the testing.md file when an feature is listed as no errors then readers of this file can know that testing was passed on every browser tested.
